## Done

- Dashboard Skeleton - Maybe Fixed (Only Skeleton I'll do till deploy to know if it's working)
- Edit Reply Modal - Fixed
- Syntax highlighter doesn't display when no postCode is inputed

## To Do

- Focused Post
- UpVote by one
- Fix getPosts fetch
- Search
- Navbar items not resetting to :before before scroll
- Saved icon stays saved on refresh if post is saved to profile
- When on mobile view, Dashboard and Emotional Response need to be altered so they're not on the bottom, other wise with lazy loading you'll never be able to get to them
